# QR-CODE-GENERATOR

Introduction :-

The project's primary aim is to develop a software tool for generating and scanning QR codes. QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes used for various purposes, including sharing URLs, contact information, Wi-Fi credentials, and more. This project provides a user-friendly interface for creating and decoding QR codes using Python.

Project Overview -

Objectives:-

The main objectives of the "QR-Code-Generator-Scanner" project are as follows:

QR Code Generation: Create a Python program that generates QR codes from text, URLs, or other data input by the user.

QR Code Scanning: Develop a QR code scanner to decode and extract information from existing QR codes.

User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies the process of generating and scanning QR codes.

Customize your QR code according to your wish

Project Implementation -

Technology Stack :-

The project is implemented using the following technologies and libraries:

Python: The core programming language used for both QR code generation and scanning.
qrcode: A Python library for generating QR codes.
opencv-python: A library for computer vision, used for QR code scanning.
webbrowser: For opening the link scanned from qr code.

Key Features :-

QR Code Generation: Users can input text or URLs and generate QR codes with a single click. The generated QR code can be saved as an image.

QR Code Scanning: The program allows users to scan QR codes using their device's camera or by selecting an image containing a QR code. Scanned information is displayed to the user.

Save and Load QR Codes: Users can save generated QR codes as image files and load existing QR codes for scanning or further editing.

Conclusion :-

The "QR-Code-Generator-Scanner" Python project successfully achieves its objectives by providing a user-friendly and versatile tool for QR code generation and scanning. It leverages Python libraries and a well-designed GUI to simplify the process of creating and decoding QR codes.

Future enhancements could include support for more QR code formats (e.g., business cards, calendar events) and improved user customization options for QR code design. Additionally, the project could benefit from regular updates to maintain compatibility with the latest Python versions and operating system changes.

This project demonstrates the power of Python for creating practical applications with real-world utility and showcases the collaborative potential of open-source software development.
